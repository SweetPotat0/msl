# Minecraft Server Loader

This Repository is a Minecraft Server Loader, meanning its an online server that controlls another local minecraft server.<br>
Combined with an application that I created, you can open/close a minecraft server on another computer, remotely.

I created it because I wanted my friends to be able to play on the server without waiting for me to turn it on.<br>
They would just open the app that I gave them and it would open the server on my computer.<br><br>

I did the server using socket.io and nodejs.<br>
The application also using socket.io and java in android.
